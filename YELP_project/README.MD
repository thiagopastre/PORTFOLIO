### Project overview

This project aims to apply the knowledge acquired during the 14 months of Data Science Degree training given by Let's Code (currently Ada Tech).

It will be divided into a few steps:

* Data Processing + Feature Engineering
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Application of Machine Learning models
* Model optimization

At the end of this project we will have a model capable of predicting, based on the characteristics provided, what will be the evaluation (or grade) that a company or business could receive when registering to use the service.
